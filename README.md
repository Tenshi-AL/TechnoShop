# About
TechnoShop is an educational project simulating an online store for computer components.
Users can browse hardware parts, compare them, build their own custom PC, add items to the shopping cart, and place orders seamlessly.

Technologies used:
- ASP.NET for building the web application
- Entity Framework for efficient data access and management
- PostgreSQL as the database backend
- Docker for containerization and easy deployment
